## Federated Experiment tracking with MLflow 
### Example of using **[NVIDIA FLARE](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/index.html)** to train an image classifier using federated averaging ([FedAvg]([FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629))) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as the deep learning training framework. This example also highlights the NVFlare streaming capability from the clients to the server.

> **_NOTE:_** 
 This example uses the *[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)* dataset and will load its data within the trainer code.
